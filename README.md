# Distraction-Recognition-CNN
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network model that takes images of people in their cars and determines whether they are attentive, drinking coffee, using their mirror, or using their radio
There is also a Logistical Regresion model with a confusiom matrix to compare performances between the two models
